- Have a collapsible activity log
		- Result of current round is displayed in a window created at the end of each round and deleted at the beginning of the next
		- make the buttons react and play a sound when clicked (js30 project 1 does this)
		- Add a name field that seems to transform into a div with the player's name inside
